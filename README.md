# A Fancy Interactive Task List


The world's most useful interactive task list



## Purpose


This task list is designed to allow users to create a new task name, due date, and task description when clicking the button to add a task

They can then drag tasks from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "Done" and back and forth to mark the progress level of a task

Tasks that are overdue will also appear as red until they are marked as done

Tasks that are due that day will appear as yellow until they are marked as done

Tasks that are not due until a later date will appear as white until they are nearly due or overdue


## Screencaps

Here are a couple screencaps of what the site should look like:
